My first project with HTML
Here I am going to practice what I learned so far. When I am done, I am going o write everything I did and learn in line number 5

Sorry, I have not even started. I am trying and learning the git add/ git commit/ git push. I want to see how it looks like

The first project is done. I practiced different things like unordered and ordered lists, anchors, images and links
